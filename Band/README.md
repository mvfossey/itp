#####Problems Faced:

Everything was decided fairly quickly. We sort of rolled with whichever first idea we had was, and developed it further. 
Different problems we had was placing the gif how we wanted it on the page. Ezra was trying to put a margin on it so it would be placed on the left, and it ended up being placed next to the picture, where he placed another one on the right to center our band image. Another problem we ran into was making the boxes around the texts, centering the texts, and deciding how the texts looked in general. They started off too small, in the wrong font, not sure how to place them. The box was made individually, put in a corner, then placed in the center with the text on top of it. It would not align unless there was a margin, because we didn't have an initial center for our code.

#####Self-Assessment:

I suggested the main ideas for the band. I said we should be a hyperpop band that's psychedelic and crazy, and for our story to be that we have been stuck in the website for several years, and hyperpop is all we know. Each of our bios are about us asking for help and trying to get out of the website. I thought everything could be super bright and suggested having an image as the background and had the code for it, but it ended up not being used. I then went ahead and made a track compiled of different hyperpop band tracks I found online warped with Cameron's vocals. After sending that track over I suggested what the sound might be for the mouse click, and wanted it to be some kind of scream but the sound ended up a little different. I had also suggested for us to make a little paragraph where we list our band values, but we ended up scratching that idea as well. 

#####Group Assessment:

Ezra had the host computer for our website. He is a super fast worker and seemed very accustomed to html code. When I coded my website, I researched many many different concepts, but he just seemed to know, which was very impressive. He came up with the band name, and general layout of the website. Cameron then created an image for our band with all our canvas profile pictures and made it look super psychedelic. The basic website rubric in general was created realtively fast, but everyone kept having more and more ideas. YuChun created different gifs to make our website even more intense. He also suggested for the mouse to make a noise when clicking somewhere. Ezra then wanted to fit our artist bios in little boxes. He also was able to import fonts from my little pony to use in our website. Ezra also made the color of the text change. We also realized we had to add an extra asset so we created a gofundme link to fund our band and escape from the website.
All in all, I think we made a good team. We definitely all stuck to what we were good at, but made suggestiosn towards everyone's seperate tasks and were quite efficient in the construction of our website. I think next time, I'd like to have done a little more of the code.
