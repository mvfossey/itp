#Final Project

####by Mila Fossey

I decided to create a webiste after one of our class lessons, where we had about 30 minutes to code the basics of what our personal digital portfolio would look like. Although, I have always been interested in in-class assignemnts, going to the library as I usually do after that class, I found myself continuing to code, and adding as many things as I could to it, and trying to make it look as much as me as possible. This is certainly not the first time I have tried to make a website for myself, but I jhave never resonated with the online wireframes and templates available. I was never able to simply do what I would have liked to, and importing everything was too much of a hassle. 

This was my Sentence Overview/Driving Question in my Final Project Proposal: How might I create a digital portfolio website showcasing my artistic projects using my coding skills in html and javascript?

Starting here already, something has changed in the outcome of the project. I decided to stricly use html and css in the coding of this website. I had thrown in an idea to use cargo as a coding template to complete my websote, but I honestly foudn it overcomplicating a lot of things for me, whereas I found it simpler to research what it was I wanted to do, and do it. 

My following resources are my friends Gigi Engalla, Guille Hernandez Martin, and  website, as a reference: https://www.gigiengalla.com, https://guillermohdez.cargo.site/
This resource is an aid in html code I have been using: https://www.w3schools.com/html/. Throughout my construction of this website, my friend Gigi and I were both building our websites, except hers were built from using an online template. 


1 Paragraph Overview:
I plan to code my personal artistic digital portfolio using html and javascript code. I understand this to be a pretty standard project for students in this class, but ever since our last class, I could not stop developing my website. I kept adding more pictures, titles, and kept developing different ideas for what I wanted to do. I want to use html in terms of everything that is 'stagnant' and use javascript for more immersive parts, or sections of the website. I'd like to make an interractive question-answer on things people can find on the website, like asking for my email, number, interests, etc. I want to make a home, music, project, contact, and about page. 

How I started:
I decided to start by creating 3 seperate textmate files that were relatively similar where I added pictures, concepts, words, titles, etc. Everything started out by looking like this:

Here, I would have a lot of fun adding different things, doing much research all throughout google on different questions I had. These questions would be simple: How do I make this font black? How do I center this image? I would mostly use https://www.w3schools.com/html/ for help on coding these. 

I had many pages I found felt like me, and I was happy with how everything looked. At some pooint in the semester, I had a call with my friend Gigi, who was equally making her website, and she tells me she is changing it completely. I ask why, and she says she wants to make it more compact, for everything to be right on the page. She decides to make a website that is all one page. I was also having a very hard time getting my navigation bar to work correctly with the links I had given it, so I was interested in seeing what that would look like for me. 

My initial idea was something more abstract, with a big background and several pictures of my face covering the screen.

I wondered what something more simple, self-explanatory would look like. Thankfully, I had just taken nice pictures of myself, so I started with an about me section at the top fo my page. Researching, figuring out, and finding code to get my text to overlay, and be on the left side of the image was definitely not simple. I ran into several issues, where I had my text boxed in a way I didn't like, or things just not aligning correctly, or text just looking wonky. I also think the code I was using was being overcomplicated, so there were certain phrases I would simplify, delete, or rewrite.
I ended up with my about me section looking like this:

I am already quite happy with the way this looks. I added some contact info.

Then I moved onto the music portion of my websoite. I really wanted to have a video there looping as an introduction to what I do. I did research to figure out this code as well, and had a hard time finding something that would play, as well as go to a video on youtube when the video was clicked. Here, I would go on reddit, or stack overflow to find other codes people had tried out and saw if they would work for me. I ended up not having it loop, but have a play button for it.

I then had an idea of making a soundcloud grid on my website where each image has a link online. I am proud to say I totally did this all by myself. I think through this I definitely discovered weird hacks that I liked using personally. A weird issue I would run into would be spacing between sentences, and paragraphs, so I would make fake headings in order for things to be spaced apart.

Making the project and contact section was pretty similar. The only think that was annoying was that I made a seperate folder in my final folder in which I put all the videos, and suddenly nothing was on the website anymore, and I could not see my videos, so I had to name everythign differently.

I still had many problems with the navigation bar. It might be very simple to solve, but for the life of me, it had a hold on my like nothing else: syntax, error, upon error, nothing worked the way I wanted it to, so now it is fake. I really tried my best with it, but it didn't understand that I did not want a home page, so this is how it ended up.

I can completely see myself adding a lot more. I wanted to keep things simple for text, and mostly just wanted videos, but if I figure something out to not make everything look so chunky, I will definitely do it.
