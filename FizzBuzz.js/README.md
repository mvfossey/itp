#Fizz Buzz

#### by Mila Fossey

I started my code by referring to the code along from last class, and went along with craeting a loop for this homework as my first statement, starting from 0 to 100. The statement I referred to in our lesson for this was for (let i = 0; i < 128; i++) {. My statement was for (let i = 0; i < 101; i++) {. I started by writing 100 instead of 101, and that did not make my code run to 100 because it starts at 0, so I changed it to 101. I then carried on to enter an if statement for "FizzBuzz" where "if an integer in the counter is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"." For this I referred to the code along from last class as well, which was if (i % 7 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) console.log(i);. I wrote if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) { console.log("FizzBuzz");. I then wrote another statement to write 2 seperate else if statements for "Fizz" and "Buzz" to specify that if teh number is only divisible by 3 it will say Fizz and if only divisible by 5 it will say Buzz. I referred to the class code along again, taking example from the statement else if (thirdNote > 64). In this context I put the values from my second statement where the number is divisible by both, split up the equation, and wrote else if (i % 3 === 0) { console.log("Fizz"); and else if (i % 5 === 0) { console.log("Buzz");. My closing statement was simply console.log(i) to write what the result would be if the integer was not divisible by either, but this made the program print that value innaccurately, and represented it as "Fizz" or "Buzz". So I changed the statement and just wrote  else { console.log(i)}. Throughout, I had a few synthax errors, but they were solved quite quickly, and I used eloquent javascript ain the whole process to test my code out.
