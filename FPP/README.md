#Final Project Proposal

###by Mila Fossey

Sentence Overview/Driving Question: How might I create a digital portfolio website showcasing my artistic projects using my coding skills in html and javascript?

My following resources are my friends Gigi Engalla, Guille Hernandez Martin, and  website, as a reference: https://www.gigiengalla.com, https://guillermohdez.cargo.site/
This resource is an aid in html code I have been using: https://www.w3schools.com/html/


1 Paragraph Overview:
I plan to code my personal artistic digital portfolio using html and javascript code. I understand this to be a pretty standard project for students in this class, but ever since our last class, I could not stop developing my website. I kept adding more pictures, titles, and kept developing different ideas for what I wanted to do. I want to use html in terms of everything that is 'stagnant' and use javascript for more immersive parts, or sections of the website. I'd like to make an interractive question-answer on things people can find on the website, like asking for my email, number, interests, etc. I want to make a home, music, project, contact, and about page. 

Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

It will overlap with my personal artistic work, as it will be a resource I will use externally, almost as a resume.
