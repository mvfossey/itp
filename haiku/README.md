# this is the place you're documenting your homework for me
# Haiku by Mila

For this first assignment, I started by finding a Haiku I liked and researched different women Haiku authors. I came across "Up on a hydro pole" by Mitsuhashi Takajo. Since I already craeted my homework subfolder in class, I started by trying to remember the process we went through by memory. I tried finding the folder with "cd Desktop" and "cd Haiku". Once I found the folder, I just typed in "say "..." -o haiku.aiff". However, the file would not save to my folder and say "file not found". I tried making new folders and naming them haiku, but this did not work either. My code was working completely fine, other than that. The only folder in my computer it would save to, was the first folder I ever created with Terminal. I equally started Terminal over again multiple times, but still no. So I created my aiff file of the haiku and saved it on my Desktop, before tragging it into the haiku folder. I referenced the GitHub lesson summary from last class a little. I did not research any seperate code, as my code was working fine, I think it's more my Desktop that has an issue.
